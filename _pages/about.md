I am a Computer Science graduate from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, with a strong passion for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software engineering. I am pursuing a Master's degree in Information Systems at Boston University, where I focus on database design, IT strategy, and software development.

As a Software Engineer in the Display Technology Group at Xiaomi, I conducted in-depth research on Android display architecture and optimized rendering pipelines to improve system performance. Additionally, as a research assistant in reinforcement learning-based video editing, published in ACMMM 2023, I explored integrating vision-language models with automatic editing techniques.

Beyond professional and research experiences, I have worked on multiple technical projects, including building a local DNS server, an NBA database in MySQL, and a program for converting 2D maps into 3D models. My technical expertise spans Python, C/C++, Java, MATLAB, SQL, and machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch and OpenCV.

I am particularly interested in software development and optimization algorithms. I am always open to collaborations and discussions on cutting-edge AI and software technologies.

Feel free to connect with me!
