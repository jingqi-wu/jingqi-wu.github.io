I am a [Computer Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/page/363) graduate from the [Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en), with a strong passion for artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software engineering. I am pursuing a Master's degree in [Information Systems](https://www.bu.edu/met/degrees-certificates/ms-computer-information-systems/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/), where I focus on software development, database design and IT strategy.

As a Software Engineer in the Display Technology Group at [Xiaomi](https://www.mi.com/us/), I conducted in-depth research on Android display architecture and optimized rendering pipelines to improve system performance. Additionally, as a research assistant in reinforcement learning-based video editing, published in ACMMM 2023, I explored integrating vision-language models with automatic editing techniques.

Beyond professional and research experiences, I have worked on multiple technical projects, including building a local DNS server, an NBA database in MySQL, and a program for converting 2D maps into 3D models. My technical expertise spans Python, C/C++, Java, MATLAB, SQL, and machine learning frameworks such as PyTorch and OpenCV.

You can find my CV here: [Jingqi Wu's curriculum vitae](../assets/curriculum_vitae_of_Jingqi_Wu.pdf)

I am particularly interested in software development and optimization algorithms. I am always open to collaborations and discussions on cutting-edge AI and software technologies.
