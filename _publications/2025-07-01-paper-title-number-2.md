*	Port and configure SDL Core on Ubuntu 20.04; build a companion demo that streams real-time telemetry between smartphones and a simulative in-vehicle HMI (Node.js), enabling <200 ms round-trip latency in bench tests.

*	Author an Xposed-based hooking toolkit to spoof geolocation in third-party apps (Java / Android Studio).

*	Design and execute 2 penetration scenarios (Compromised Mobile System and Man-in-the-Middle Attack); uncover 7 critical vulnerabilities and propose counter-measures adopted in the paper.
